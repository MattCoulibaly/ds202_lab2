## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
hist(choco$Rating)
# The ratings are normally distributed with outliers between 4 and 5.
```

```{r}
summary(choco)
summary(choco[choco$Cocoa.Pct < 61, ])
summary(choco[choco$Cocoa.Pct > 91, ])
# I believe that ratings do depend on cocao percentage because chocolate bars with less than 61% cocao have an average rating of 2.98 while chocolate bars with more than 91% cocao have an average rating of 2.28.
